### Installing

To use this plugin, install it with jspm like so:

```sh
jspm install less=npm:systemjs-less-plugin
```

**Starting from version 1.8** this plugin has no dependencies. Instead, we're bundling 
precompiled lessjs versions for the browser and for node.


### NPM doesn't work!

It's very uncommon for NPM to be down, but if that's your case or
for any other reson you rather use github, then this is the way:

```sh
jspm install less=github:huasofoundries/systemjs-less-plugin
````
